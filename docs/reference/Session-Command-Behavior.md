# Session Command Behavior - X Unfollow App

## ðŸ”§ Functional Session Commands

### **How Commands Should Work**

When you invoke session commands, they should create actual files and perform real actions, not just provide text responses.

#### **"consolidate progress" Command**
**Expected Behavior**:
- âœ… Creates timestamped file: `docs/progress/mini-consolidations/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-mini-consolidation.md`
- âœ… Includes current accomplishments, next priorities, blocking issues
- âœ… Updates project context automatically

**File Format**:
```markdown
# Mini Consolidation - YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM

## Quick Status Update
**Project**: X Unfollow App
**Layer**: [Current Layer]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]

## Current Accomplishments
- [List current progress]

## Next Priorities  
- [List immediate next steps]

## Blocking Issues
- [List any blockers]

## Notes
- [Important insights or context]
```

#### **Other Commands Should Also Be Functional**
- **"end session and consolidate"** â†’ Creates session log + updates documentation
- **"clean vault"** â†’ Actually moves files and organizes structure  
- **"prep next session"** â†’ Updates context files and priorities
- **"GO"** â†’ Loads context and displays current state

### **Implementation Note**
Session commands should perform actual file operations and updates, not just conversational responses. This provides real brain-saving automation and maintains project organization automatically.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Session Command Status

**Layer 2 Focus**: Error classification implementation in app.py line ~450
**Next Command Use**: "GO" to start Layer 2 development with full context loading
**Expected Flow**: Work â†’ "consolidate progress" (creates file) â†’ "end session and consolidate" (full documentation)

This ensures the organizational system provides real automation value! ðŸš€
