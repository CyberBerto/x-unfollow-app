# Phase 3.82: Core App Debugging

*Focus: Get the X unfollow app working reliably*

## Main Goal
Debug and validate core X unfollow functionality - batch processing accounts reliably.

## Simple Session Plan

### 1. Test Basic Functionality
- Start the app and verify it connects
- Try unfollowing 1-2 accounts manually
- Check if batch processing works for 5-10 accounts
- Fix any obvious errors

### 2. Improve Reliability  
- Test error handling (network issues, rate limits)
- Ensure app doesn't crash during batch operations
- Verify memory usage is stable
- Add better user feedback/progress indicators

### 3. Validate Batch Processing
- Test with 20-50 accounts to find issues
- Optimize timing and rate limit handling
- Ensure clean shutdown and restart capability

## Success Criteria
- [ ] App runs without crashing
- [ ] Can unfollow accounts in batches reliably
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully (network, rate limits)
- [ ] Ready for real-world usage

**Real priority**: Getting the unfollow app working properly
