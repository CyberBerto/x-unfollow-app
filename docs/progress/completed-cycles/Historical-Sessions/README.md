# Historical Sessions Archive

## Purpose
This folder contains all session logs and development history from previous phases of the X Unfollow App development. These files are preserved for reference but are not part of active development workflow.

## Organization

### **Phase-Based Development** (Archived)
Historical sessions organized by development phases (Phase 3.1, 3.2, etc.) before adopting the current systematic layer-based approach.

### **Legacy Templates** (Archived)
Previous session templates and tracking systems before streamlining to current essential templates.

### **Development Evolution** (Archived)
Shows progression from complex feature-first approach to current systematic refactor methodology.

## Value
- **Pattern Learning**: Review what approaches worked and what didn't
- **Decision Context**: Understand why current systematic approach was adopted
- **Reference**: Historical implementation details if needed for comparison

## Current Development
For active development work, see:
- **`00-ACTIVE/`** - Current session guides
- **`01-CYCLES/`** - Active development cycles
- **`02-PROGRESS/`** - Current progress tracking
