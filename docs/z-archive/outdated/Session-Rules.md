# Simple Session Rules - Anti-Bloat

## 📋 Session Workflow
1. **Start**: Use `Quick-Session-Start.md` for context
2. **Work**: Take notes directly in session files or app
3. **End**: Fill out `Quick-Session-End.md` with next steps
4. **Clean**: Move completed work to appropriate folders

## 🧹 Weekly Cleanup (5 minutes)
- Move completed layers to `02-PROGRESS/`
- Archive old session notes to `08-ARCHIVE/`
- Keep only current work in `00-ACTIVE/`

## 📁 File Movement Rules
- **Active work** → `00-ACTIVE/` (max 5 files)
- **Today's progress** → `01-CYCLES/` 
- **Completed layers** → `02-PROGRESS/`
- **Everything old** → `08-ARCHIVE/`

## 🎯 Keep It Simple
- Use existing Quick-Session files (they work great)
- No complex automation needed
- Manual cleanup once per week
- Focus on coding, not file management

**The existing system works - just need to move old stuff to archive regularly.**
