cw# X Unfollow App Optimization Log

*Auto-generated development notes for X Unfollow Flask app optimization*

## Project Summary
**Goal**: Transform overcomplicated X unfollow web app into lean, reliable tool focused on 1 unfollow every 15 minutes for sustained background operation.

**Key Issue**: Current codebase has grown to 807 lines (app.py) and 1,255 lines (script.js) with excessive features causing reliability problems and API rate limit waste.

## Analysis Results

### Current Codebase Issues
- **app.py**: 807 lines (target: ~200 lines)
  - 20+ routes including unnecessary debug endpoints
  - Complex rate limit tracking causing API waste
  - Multiple unfollow methods (single, slow batch, realistic batch)
  - Bloated with test features not needed for core functionality

- **script.js**: 1,255 lines (target: ~300 lines)
  - Complex rate limit timer systems
  - Multiple status checking calls burning through user_lookup rate limits
  - Excessive UI features not related to core batch unfollowing

- **Root Cause**: Previous attempts to add "smart" rate limit tracking actually caused problems by adding unnecessary API calls

### Core Features to Keep
1. **slow_batch_worker()** - Main 15-minute interval batch processing
2. **unfollow_slow_batch()** - Batch startup endpoint
3. **slow_batch_status()** - Progress tracking
4. **cancel_slow_batch()** - Operation cancellation
5. Basic authentication and CSV import

### Features to Remove
1. **unfollow_single()** - Not needed for batch focus
2. **debug_api()** - Unnecessary debug endpoint
3. **login_status()** - Causes API rate limit waste
4. Complex retry logic in status endpoint
5. Timer systems for rate limit countdown
6. Extract usernames functionality (can use CSV instead)

## Phase 2: Codebase Trimming Plan

### Step 1: app.py Cleanup
- Remove debug endpoints and single unfollow
- Simplify rate limit tracking
- Remove complex user info retry logic
- Keep only batch-related functionality

### Step 2: script.js Streamlining
- Remove complex rate limit timers
- Simplify status checking
- Remove extract usernames feature
- Focus on CSV import and batch operations

### Step 3: Template Cleanup
- Remove single unfollow UI
- Remove extract usernames section
- Simplify to CSV import + batch operations only

## Development Log

### Session Start: 2025-06-12
**Status**: Phase 2 - Codebase Trimming (In Progress)
**Current State**: Authentication working, began systematic bloat removal

### Progress Summary - Phase 2 Trimming

#### app.py Cleanup Results
- **Before**: 807 lines â†’ **After**: 646 lines (161 lines removed - 20% reduction)
- **Removed Functions**:
  - `login_status()` - Was causing unnecessary API calls that burned user_lookup rate limits
  - `unfollow_single()` - Not needed for batch-focused operation
  - `debug_api()` - Debug endpoint not needed for production
  - `check_local_rate_limits_and_wait()` - Complex rate limit logic causing issues
- **Simplified Functions**:
  - `status()` - Removed complex rate limit message handling, now returns cached data only

#### Key Technical Changes Made
1. **Eliminated API Rate Limit Waste**: Removed status endpoint calls that were repeatedly hitting user_lookup API
2. **Focused on Core Feature**: Removed single unfollow to focus purely on 15-minute batch processing
3. **Simplified Status Checking**: Status endpoint now uses cached data instead of making new API calls

#### Commands Used for Reference
```bash
# File analysis commands
wc -l app.py                    # Count lines before/after
grep -n "def " app.py           # List all functions

# Development tools used
MultiEdit tool                  # Multiple edits in single operation
Edit tool                       # Single precision edits  
Read tool                       # File content analysis
TodoWrite/TodoRead             # Task tracking
```

#### Learning Notes
- **MultiEdit vs Edit**: MultiEdit is more efficient for removing multiple functions at once
- **Function Removal Strategy**: Remove entire functions rather than commenting out to reduce bloat
- **Rate Limit Root Cause**: The original issue was caused by too many status checks, not the batch processing itself

#### script.js Cleanup Results (COMPLETED)
- **Before**: 1,255 lines â†’ **After**: 891 lines (364 lines removed - 29% reduction)
- **Removed Functions**:
  - `handleSingleUnfollow()` - Single unfollow functionality (43 lines)
  - `handleExtractUsernames()` + `extractUsernamesFromText()` - Username extraction (68 lines)
  - `startUserInfoTimer()` + `startUserInfoCountdown()` - Complex timer system (50 lines)
  - `checkLoginStatus()` - Login status API calls causing rate limit waste (15 lines)
  - All rate limit message functions: `showLoginRateLimitMessages()`, `showUnfollowRateLimitMessages()`, `hideLoginRateLimitMessages()`, `hideUnfollowRateLimitMessages()`, `startCountdownTimer()`, `updateUnfollowButtonStates()`, `enableUnfollowButtons()` (130+ lines)

#### API Rate Limit Waste Elimination
**Key Decision**: Remove all complex timer and status checking systems that were making unnecessary API calls

**Token Burning Rate Tracking Ideas**:
1. **API Call Logging**: Add simple counter in `api.py` to log each API endpoint hit with timestamp
2. **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Track actual vs. expected rate limit consumption
3. **Session Tracking**: Log user_lookup vs unfollow API call ratios per session
4. **Obsidian Integration**: Auto-append API usage stats to this file every hour

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# In api.py - simple tracking without additional API calls
api_usage_log = []

def log_api_call(endpoint_type, success=True):
    api_usage_log.append({
        'timestamp': time.time(),
        'endpoint': endpoint_type,
        'success': success
    })
    
    # Save to file every 10 calls to avoid memory buildup
    if len(api_usage_log) % 10 == 0:
        save_api_usage_to_obsidian()
```

#### template/index.html Cleanup Results (COMPLETED)
- **Removed UI Elements**:
  - Single unfollow form and input field (15 lines)
  - Extract usernames textarea and button (20 lines)
  - Updated usage guide to reflect simplified workflow (3 edits)

**ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Complete - Total Reduction Summary:**
- **app.py**: 807 â†’ 646 lines (161 lines removed)
- **script.js**: 1,255 â†’ 891 lines (364 lines removed)
